# Blog app in php, with the mvc approche.

This is a blog app with an admin dashboard, using the mvc architecture approche purely in php, with a custom mini framework and template engine for template processing.


## Note: 
`
  I'm not a professional php dev nor used mvc pattern before, so appart from the assignement, this project is for learning purposes. So i'll be glad to hear your opinions, some changes to make
